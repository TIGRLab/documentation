All documentation is on the wiki: https://github.com/TIGRLab/documentation/wiki

This repo mostly holds images and other attachments needed for the wiki pages. 
New images and other attachments should be added to a folder with the same 
name as the wiki page for easy management as pages are modified over time. 
Please also give your images a meaningful name (i.e. dont use something like 
'1.png')
