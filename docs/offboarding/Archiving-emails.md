# Archiving Emails

The CAMH email account has a relatively small inbox size. If you are running out of space, or just want to back up your  important emails [this page has instructions](http://scotty.camh.ca/how-to/managing-email) on how to do so. You may need to use one of the CAMH workstations in the lab to do this.

**Be aware:** When someone leaves CAMH, CAMH IT deactivates their email account immediately (sometimes exactly on their last day). In the past some lab members have found that their emails were lost permanently when they later came back to the lab and got their account reactivated. To prevent this we can organize and store your email backups on our servers for you, just ask a lab admin for help.
