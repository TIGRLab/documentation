## :unlock: Logging in

The Dashboard is found at http://srv-dashboard.camhres.ca/. This website is only
available on CAMH's network, which means that if you're working offsite you must first log in to https://remote.camh.ca and open Google Chrome through that site before entering the dashboard's URL.

The Dashboard authenticates users via GitHub, so if you do not have a GitHub account you will need to [make one](https://github.com). The first time you access the dashboard, after making your GitHub account, you should click on the request account button, as shown below. This will take you to a page where you can request access for your
GitHub account. Once your account has been approved by an admin, you can return to srv-dashboard.camhres.ca and use the 'GitHub Login' button to login with your github username and password. If you do not receive approval from an admin within 72 hours email us at tigr.lab@camh.ca to ask us for assistance.
