## MR Database Information
Neuroimaging data collected during the study will be stored in an **online MRI Database (XNAT) server** hosted by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH)â€™s **Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics (KCNI)**. The following information can be used to access the database:

**Database:** https://xnat.camh.ca

**Documentation:** https://kcniconfluence.camh.ca/display/NPP/

**Contact:**  tigrlab@camh.ca

## Accessing the MRI Database
Project members requiring access to the KCNI XNAT instance will need to complete an [online training course](https://kcniconfluence.camh.ca/display/NPP/XNAT+Workshop) and then [request an XNAT user account](https://kcniconfluence.camh.ca/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=6455465#XNATIntroduction-NewUserRequest).


**Details on User Request Form:**
1. For the first question click **XNAT**.
2. Set **Aristotle Voineskos** as the primary investigator, the associated e-mail is aristotle.voineskos@camh.ca.
3. The Neuroinformatics platform code is the XNAT Project ID for your associated site. Refer to the naming conventions section below for more details.

**NOTE:**
The only browsers that are currently supported are FireFox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. Internet explorer users will run into issues.

## XNAT Naming Convention
In order to facilitate automatic data management, imaging data uploaded to XNAT must adhere to a common naming convention as implemented by the Krembil Neuroinformatics Institute (KCNI) Platform at CAMH. Further information can be found in the following links:
- [XNAT Naming Convention](https://kcniconfluence.camh.ca/display/NPP/XNAT+Naming+Convention)

Data stored in XNAT adheres to the following hierarchy:
- Project
  - Subject A
    - Experiment A
      - Scan 1
      - Scan 2
      - Scan 3
    - Experiment B
      - Scan 1
      - Scan 2
      - Scan 3
