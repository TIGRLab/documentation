This page lists links to our various servers, paid subscriptions and passpack (where we keep all our login credentials for lab members to use).

## TIGRlab - general

[Lab website (GitHub)](http://imaging-genetics.camh.ca/). This is the most-used website, that has member profiles, information about projects and tools, etc. It is currently being maintained by Erin.

[Lab website (CAMH)](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/campbell-family-mental-health-research-institute/research-focus-campbell-institute/kimel-family-translational-imaging-genetics-lab). This is our official but bare-bones website on camh.ca (note: currently under construction).

[Lab meeting](https://tinyurl.com/tigr-presentation) presentation slides, as well as [lab posters](https://tinyurl.com/tigr-posters), IMS students' [PAC meetings](https://tinyurl.com/tigr-pac), and [talks](https://tinyurl.com/tigr-talks) are archived in google drive.

[Lab calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/1/r?tab=oc&pli=1). Please add events that would be of interest to the group here. Also, if you're planning time away, add it here so other's know (please note that this doesn't take the place of clearing time off with Aristotle/Dielle).

[GoToMeeting](https://www.gotomeeting.com/en-ca). We have a subscription to video conference software. The account is shared with all lab members, and meetings must be scheduled. Sign-in details are in PassPack.

[PassPack](https://www.passpack.com/online/). This is our password manager, and has an always-current collection of links, usernames, and passwords to a number of platforms that are useful to lab members, including common email addresses (including the lab listserv kimel-lab@info2.camh.net, and our tigrlab@camh.ca and tigrlab@gmail.com email addresses), software (GoToMeeting, Adobe Illustrator, PaperPile), journal submission websites, and data repositories. Please add and edit passwords as required. Ask a staff member for up-to-date login credentials.

## TIGRlab - data management

[QC Dashboard](srv-dashboard.camhres.ca). The Dashbaord was developed in the lab to facilitate QA and QC of imaging data. The Dashboard requires GitHub authentication.

[XNAT](https://xnat.imaging-genetics.camh.ca/app/template/Login.vm). XNAT is our imaging database. All of the imaging data that we manage is stored in XNAT, in addition to our file system.  

[REDCap](https://edc.camhx.ca/redcap/). We are increasingly using REDCap for non-imaging data management. You can request an account via an IMG request. Please note that the SPINS study is hosted by [AHRC at St. Mikes](https://redcap.smh.ca/redcap/), and [regulated clinical trials](https://redcap.camhx.ca/redcap/index.php?action=myprojects) also have their own instance at CAMH.
