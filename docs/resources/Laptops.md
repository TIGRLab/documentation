# Laptops

The lab has a number of laptops that can be used by any lab member. These laptops are stored in the locked drawer in room 102 (ask a lab member if you don't know which drawer or where to get the key). It's important that you fill out the sheet in that drawer when you sign one out, and update the sheet when you bring it back, to help us avoid losing them. Note that while the laptops are free to use and do what you like with, you should never take them off CAMH property (i.e. don't take them home overnight).
