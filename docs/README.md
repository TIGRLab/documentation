# TIGRLab Documentation

This site holds most of TIGRLab's documentation for lab members. For documentation that may contain private info or that is only relevant to lab staff [see here instead](https://kcniconfluence.camh.ca/display/TIGRcatsadmin). To view that page you must login with your camh account (firstname_lastname, and camh password). If, after logging in, you still can't view that page contact a lab admin (e.g. Dawn / Erin) to ask for access.
