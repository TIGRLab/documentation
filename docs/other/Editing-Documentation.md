# Editing the Documentation

This project was made using [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/). Steps for setting the documentation using docsify were pulled from their [Quick Start](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart).

Note: You must have npm installed to preview the website locally.

Pull the repo for the documentation to your local machine.

`git clone https://github.com/TIGRLab/documentation`

If you don't have docsify installed on your npm yet, do so using the following command:

`npm i docsify-cli -g`

Once you're in the repo and you have docsify installed, you can then preview the website by typing:

`docsify serve docs`

You should get the following back:

```
Serving <path/to/repo> now.
Listening at http://localhost:3000
```

Then, you can go to the localhost link to see the documentation running locally using the files currently in the repo.

Now you can edit the files locally and see your changes on the locally running documentation! Editing the files are as simple as editing the markdown pages in the repo's `docs` folder. 

**Note:** Do *not* edit or commit the files in `docs/_site`. These files are generated by npm every time you view your copy of the documentation and are overwritten every time npm is run. Editing these files will result in no changes on the documentation.

Once you are done editing the markdown files locally, simply commit and push your changes to have them update the website. It may take a couple minutes for the website to update.
