# Tips for Reproducible Research

[Go to Erin's Lab meeting slides on this topic](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XhfGayWVvSP9IfOl-6UOyYEhznlx286NkwuP1sxTjBU/edit?usp=sharing)

## Here are some links to useful tutorial sites on the topic

### Using Git

We have a very basic overview of how to [use git here](/technical_skills/Using-Git).

Jenny Bryan's Happy Git with R book is a super comprehensive book (still in draft form) that details how to use git for an R analysis project using the helper tools in rstudio. ([find it here](http://happygitwithr.com/))

For organising a python based analysis project. Check out this repo for tips (https://github.com/uwescience/shablona)

## Linking files

One way to cut down on the size of use of hard disk space, and to keep a nicer record of where your data is coming from is to create symbolic links instead of copying files. Here's some extra information on how to do that.

* this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=va4CedGgGo8)
* this [online tutorial](https://www.nixtutor.com/freebsd/understanding-symbolic-links/)
* `lndir` ([man page here](https://linux.die.net/man/1/lndir)) will let you create a "shadow" directory tree made entirely of symbolic links

## BIDS and BIDS apps

These papers do an excellent job of explaining the motivation behind these and how to use them.

## Bookdown and R markdown for R

Erin highly recommends using R markdown and using the tool [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) for R projects.
