Who this is for
===============

-  Anyone who helps curate the data in ``/archive``

Overview
========

You should first delete the misnamed files from XNAT and the file
system. In the file system, delete the participant's files at the
highest level, /archive/data/studyname. In XNAT, first delete the
participant's MR data THEN delete the participant (make sure you delete
their MR data first!).

scans.csv is a file that can direct a participant's data to a new target
name and folder. It has four columns that require filling in (the
descriptions are included below):

+----------------+----------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| source\_name   | target\_name   | PatientName           | StudyID               |
+================+================+=======================+=======================+
| zipfilename    | desired name   | from dicom preamble   | from dicom preamble   |
+----------------+----------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

1. source\_name: the name of the zip file associated with your
   participant's data. To fill this in, cd to the dicom directory and
   use 'ls -l'. It should list participantid.zip --> ../zipfilename.zip.
   Paste this zipfilename (no extension) under the source\_name column.
   (N.B. zipfilename often does not match the participantid, which is
   why this step is necessary rather than just looking for your
   participant ID in /zips.)

2. target\_name: the desired new name for your participant, following
   all naming conventions.

Numbers 3 and 4 require values from the dicom preamble. Navigate to the
zips folder. Type in:

``module load /archive/code/packages.module``

``source activate``

``archive-manifest.py zipfilename.zip``

You will see a csv formatted file. Grab the values from there.
