Who is this for?
================

-  Anyone who will access the data stored in ``/archive``
-  Anyone who will help curate the data stored in ``/archive``

This document describes a naming protocol for our data files that
explicitly indicates who, what, when, and where the data was acquired.
The naming protocol is inspired by the `OBI naming
scheme <https://github.com/TIGRLab/spins/raw/master/docs/guides/spred-upload-tutorial-v1.5.pdf>`__.

Data Naming Protocol
====================

Standard Prefix
---------------

Generally, each data file should start with a string that follows this
pattern:

::

    [study]_[site]_[subjectid]_[timepoint]_[session]

Where, - ``[study]`` is a short code indicating the overall study (eg.
"``DTI``") and may be modified to indicate major study protocol
differences (e.g. "``COGBDY``" vs. "COGBDO" to distinguish between young
and older COGBD protocols). - ``[site]`` indicates the site/scanner used
(e.g. ``CMH`` indicates the CAMH 3T scanner) - ``[timepoint]`` indicates
which time point in the study design the data was collected for (e.g. 01
for baseline, 02 for 5yr follow up, etc..) - ``[session]`` is a
sequential numbering over scans at each time point in order that
repeats/redos are obvious (i.e. the first scan at time point ``01`` is
labeled ``_01_01``, and a redo scan to collect a mis-acquired sequence
would be labeled with as ``_01_02``).

For example, the first time a follow up scan for subject H240 is
completed in the "DTI" study using the CAMH scanner, we might label it
as ``DTI_CMH_H240_02_01``. If the subject had to come in a second day to
complete or repeat some acquisitions, we would label those files as
``DTI_CMH_H240_02_02`` (i.e. a session code of '02' because this is the
second time they've come in for the '02' timepoint).

The following table lists our current studies by name, study and site
codes to use in the naming, and a few example file names to illustrate
this naming protocol in action:

Naming Scans Within Exams
-------------------------

The naming scheme above specifies naming an entire dataset acquired at a
point in time, but the naming scheme can be extended to label different
kinds of data within that acquisition. For instance, in an MR exam, each
series could be labelled separately to indicate T1 vs. T2 vs. DTI data.

Generally, extending naming should follow this convention:

::

    <prefix>_[tag]_[series]_[description]

where - ``<prefix>`` is the full prefix as described above. - ``[tag]``
is a friendly short code to indicate the type of data, e.g. ``T1``,
``T2``, ``DTI33-1000`` - ``[series]`` is a number enumerating this
acquisition within the exam. - ``[description]`` is longer and more
specific string that describes the data. It should not contain
underscores (\_) or spaces. For instance, for exam series, the
description field should be mangled (see below) version of the MR
scanner's series description field, e.g. ``AXIAL-DIFFUSION-TENSOR-23``

For instance, for the exam ``DTI_TGH_H001_02_01``, we would have the
following extended file names:

+--------------------------+-------------------+
| Series Description       | Full Name         |
+==========================+===================+
| 3-PLANE LOC              | ``DTI_TGH_H001_02 |

+--------------------------+-------------------+

| (23)                     | _01_DTI23-1000_05 |

|                          | TENSOR-23``       |
+--------------------------+-------------------+

**Mangling** is simply this: characters that aren't numbers or letters
are converted to a ``-`` character, and runs of ``-``\ s are converted
to a single ``-``.

Study Naming
============

The protocol above outlines how data files should be unambiguously named
after participants and sites are given identifiers. *This* section
describes how, for our specific studies, we will generate new
identifiers.

DTI Study
---------

Subject identifiers follow the format:

    diagnosis code (``H`` or ``S``) + four digit number

For example, ``H003`` or ``S080``. H = healthy control, S =
schizophrenia. Historically there a few variations on this theme when
the identifiers are written down:

1. Identifiers may start with ``06``, e.g. ``06H003`` or ``06S080``.
2. Identifiers may end with ``_2`` to indicate a follow up scan. E.g.
   ``H003_2`` or even ``06H008_2``.

Nevertheless, ongoing, when we refer to a DTI subject identifier, we
mean the four character code version (e.g. 'H003', 'S080', ...).

Study protocol changes, and interaction with the SPINS study
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DTI study has undergone several changes in protocol (**TODO:** ref
study protocol documents). However, essentially there have been two
phases, pre-SPINS and post-SPINS. In the pre-SPINS phase, all
participants were given IDs as described above, and scanned at TGH and
CAMH sites. Once the SPINS study started, all participants under 51 are
*also* participants of SPINS, and so are given *both* a DTI and a SPINS
identifier (and, they are acquired at CAMH under the MR unit study code
SPIN1MR). Participants 51 and older are *only* part of the DTI study
(and, acquired using the CAMH ``DTI3MR`` study code).

Participants that have had an baseline scan pre-SPINS (and so only have
a DTI identifier) but then return for a follow-up scan are treated as
described above (i.e. given a baseline SPINS identifier if they are
under 51 years old, but also given a DTI identifier).

Here's a table with some examples illustrating the above:

+-------+--------+------------------------+----------------------------+--------------------------+
| Age   | Subj   | Scan Type              | SPINS ID                   | DTI ID                   |
+=======+========+========================+============================+==========================+
| 46    | H240   | Baseline               | ``SPN01_CMH_H240_01_01``   | ``DTI_CMH_H240_01_01``   |
+-------+--------+------------------------+----------------------------+--------------------------+
| 51    | H240   | Followup               | n/a                        | ``DTI_CMH_H240_02_01``   |
+-------+--------+------------------------+----------------------------+--------------------------+
| 40    | H107   | Baseline (pre-SPINS)   | n/a                        | ``DTI_CMH_H107_01_01``   |
+-------+--------+------------------------+----------------------------+--------------------------+
| 45    | H107   | Followup (SPINS)       | ``SPN01_CMH_H107_01_01``   | ``DTI_CMH_H107_02_01``   |
+-------+--------+------------------------+----------------------------+--------------------------+
