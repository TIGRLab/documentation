Transferring Large Datasets
===========================

Transfer files via the SCC. The RIC network (our home network) should
only be used to transfer 100-200 GB a day max. For example, to copy data
to SciNet via the SCC:

.. code:: sh

    # First, create an empty folder on the SCC 
    jp@tigrlab:~$ ssh scc mkdir mnt

    # Mount the folder of interest (e.g. /projects/jp)
    # The port 9876 can be any number between 1024-66535
    jp@tigrlab:~$ ssh -R 9876:localhost:22 scc sshfs jp@localhost:/projects/jp mnt -p 9876

    # From a separate terminal, connect to SciNet datamover node
    jp@tigrlab:~$ ssh scinet
    jp@scinet-login:~$ ssh datamover1

    # from the Scinet datamover node, rsync your data from the scc
    jp@scinet-datamover:~$ rsync -az scc:mnt/myproject /scratch/.../ 

Affiliations
============

The official affiliation you should list for work done in the TIGR lab
is: > Kimel Family Translational Imaging-Genetics Research Lab, Research
Imaging Centre, Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre
for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Canada

This is a reminder that the University of Toronto and the TAHSN
hospitals (and their research institutes) have agreed that faculty
members should list their U of T affiliation, in addition to their
hospital affiliation, in all their publications and public
presentations. The Deanâ€™s Office, Faculty of Medicine has suggested that
the following formats be used to acknowledge the University department
in all publications and public presentations:

-  Short form - Hospital or Research Institute, Department of
   Psychiatry, University of Toronto, street address
-  Long form - Research Institute/Clinical Program, Hospital (and, where
   appropriate, Corporation, i.e., UHN), Department of Psychiatry,
   University of Toronto, street Address
