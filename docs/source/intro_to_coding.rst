Who this page is for:
=====================

::

    - Lab members about to start writing code for themselves or the lab
    - New and new-ish programmers

This page describes some of tools and practices you can use when writing
any kind of code.

Certainly checkout the `Software Carpentry
Lessons <https://software-carpentry.org/lessons>`__ for more advice and
options.

Version Control
===============

You need to track your changes as you hack, keep a record of what you
did and why, and share your code with others. You need a version control
system. I recommend you learn `Git <https://git-scm.com>`__ and learn
how to use `github <https://github.com>`__ to host your code repository
online.

**Note**: Git sucks. It's difficult to use, hard to understand, and easy
to get lost in. It's also very popular and there is lots of help online
on how to use it and get out of sticky situations you inevitably will
get yourself in.

Editors / Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
====================================================

Learning a fully-featured editor or development environment can be
daunting, but I promise you'll thank yourself for it (and so will your
hands and wrists). These are tools designed to make writing code easier,
and with fewer errors.

-  ``vi`` (aka ``vim``) - general purpose text-editor with a steep
   learning curve, but a big payoff. Type ``vimtutor`` at the command
   line to start learning. Trust me: it gets better.
-  Python: `Pycharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm>`__ or `Wing
   IDE <https://wingware.com>`__. Both are friendly, and include all the
   features grown-ups want: syntax highlighting, code completion,
   debugging, etc..
-  R: `RStudio <https://www.rstudio.org>`__

Shell
