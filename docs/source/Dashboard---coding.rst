Adding new metrics for display on the dashboard.
================================================

Once metrics are stored in the database adding them to the dashboard is
a relatively simple process. Currently only displaying metrics for FMRI
and DTI type scans are supported for human scans. Phantoms also support
T1.

The list of metrics to display are defined in the file
``dashboard/config.py``.
